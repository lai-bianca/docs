## Agentic Document Extraction

The LandingAI [Agentic Document Extraction](https://va.landing.ai/demo/doc-extraction) tool extracts structured information from visually complex documents with text, tables, pictures, charts, and other information. The API returns the extracted data in a hierarchical format and pinpoints the exact location of each element.

The `agentic-doc` Python library wraps around the [Agentic Document Extraction](https://va.landing.ai/demo/doc-extraction) API to add more features and support to the document extraction process. For example, using this library allows you to process much longer documents.

Learn more about the Agentic Document Extraction API [here](https://support.landing.ai/docs/document-extraction).
