## Chat with Document
After the Agentic Document Extraction app processes the file, you can use the **Chat with Document** tool in the right-hand panel to interact with the document.

The Chat with Document tool is an LLM layered on top of the Agentic Document Extraction API. The chat tool showcases how the API accurately extracts and understands document data, including element locations. Use the chat tool to get inspired for how you can build custom solutions on top of the API.

The Chat with Document tool suggests a few prompts based on your document. You can also enter your own prompts.
